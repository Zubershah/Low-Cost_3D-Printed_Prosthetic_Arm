# Abstract
<br>
The high cost and limited accessibility of traditional prosthetic arms create a significant barrier
for many individuals in need of functional limb replacements. This project presents the design
and development of a low-cost, 3D-printed prosthetic arm that provides an affordable
alternative without compromising functionality. Using widely available materials and 3D
printing technology, the prosthetic arm incorporates a modular design, customizable
components, and efficient control mechanisms powered by servo motors and sensors. The
lightweight design ensures comfort and ease of use, while the affordability and scalability make
it an accessible solution for individuals who lack access to expensive prosthetic options. By
leveraging open-source designs and advancements in additive manufacturing, this initiative
aims to democratize prosthetic technology and improve quality of life for those requiring limb
assistance.
